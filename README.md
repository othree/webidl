WEBIDL files
============

All webidl files from https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/webidl/  
Including the `CSS2Properties.webidl`.

Because the mozilla-central project is very huge(1.83GB).
And I need latest webidl files only.

Notice: Mozilla's webidl file is not standard webidl file. Their file have some custom extended attributes. And follow Web IDL second edition(draft now).

Requirement
===========

OSX requires Node 0.10. 0.12 is not able to install dependency.
